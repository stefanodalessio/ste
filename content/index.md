Dear human,
this is where I publish some of my artistic & media research and teaching resources.

If you want to see my projects, you can find them in my [**PORTFOLIO**](https://cargocollective.com/stefanodalessio) website.

If you want to write me, use this [**CONTACT**](https://cargocollective.com/stefanodalessio/CONTACT) form.
If you want to be included in my newsletter (4 times a year, no spam!), just ask for it through the same form.

If you want to hear some old music, there's an unmaintained **[SOUNDCLOUD](https://soundcloud.com/stefanodalessio)** page of mine.

If you want to connect via socials, I'm experimenting with [Mastodon](https://%40ste@tldr.nettime.org), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/stefanodalessio.bsky.social), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/stefanodalessio).
I also have two meta accounts on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stfndlss/) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stedalessio) but I am looking forward to not using them anymore.

For now, the main purpose of this website is to host [[Ploc']], a blog about embodied interaction, new media, performing arts, experimental music, art, cutting-edge technology, and who knows what else.
Feel free to surf around using the explorer, the search bar, or the graph visible at the sides (if your screen is large enough) or by clicking on text links and tags.

Cheers!

Stefano
